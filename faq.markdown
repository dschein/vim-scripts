For Script Users
================

**Q:** The files are correct but they're in the wrong places!  This repo can't be used by Pathogen.

**A:** Scripts come in all sorts of weird formats and layouts.
We've fixed them the best we can but there are bound to be a few that
slipped through the cracks.  File an issue with that describes the
changes needed.

**Q:** A script repository appears corrupted.<br/>
**Q:** When I clone a script, the working directory has changes that need to be committed.

**A:** We've seen this once before.  File an issue and we'll regenerate the repo..

**Q:** Can you fix a bug in one of your scripts?

**A:** Unfortunately there's nothing the vim-scripts mirror can
do about this.  You'll need to notify the script's author.

**Q:** Is the mirror up-to-date?

**A:** The scripts are updated multiple times per day based on the
RSS feed.  The most recent changes can be found on the GitHub project
page, and the results of each scrape can be found somewhere on here.
**TODO TODO**

**Q:** Why are the commit messages so horrible?

**A:** Unfortunately there is no standard for how to write the
release notes for a script so we just mirrored them verbatim.
Trying to reformat them is likely to make things even worse.

**Q:** Why can't I file an issue on the script?

**A:** The issues and wikis are turned off for all scripts because
ithere's little chance the script's original author would ever see them.
Still, some people have asked to be able to leave issues even if nobody
ever reads them.  This needs more discussion.
**TODO TODO**: create issues where people can comment on whether to
turn the issues and wiki tabs on.


For Script Developers
=====================

**Q:** Can I point the vim-scripts repo at my official GitHub repo?<br/>
**Q:** Can I send you some fixes for a script?

**A:** No, vim-scripts is simply a mirror of <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php">Vim's site</a>.  Send your changes to the original author.
Of course, you can always fork a vim-scripts repo for yourself.

**Q:** My commits don't have my icon next to them.

**A:** Your email address is probably different.  **TODO TODO** Expand on this.
