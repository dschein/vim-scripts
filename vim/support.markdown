If you find a script that has been improperly packaged
or can't immediately be used with Pathogen, please
[file an issue](http://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper/issues)
on the [vim-scraper](http://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper) package.

If you'd like to report on a bug in one of these scripts,
contact the script's original author.  You can fork the repository,
fix it yourself, and then ask the author to pull your changes.  When the
fixed script appears upstream, it will quickly be mirrored here.

Don't bother messaging the vim-scripts account!  It's just a scraper
robot and will never reply.  Do feel free to
[file an issue](http://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper/issues).
for pretty much anything you'd like to chat about.  Issues aren't just for bugs.

If you find a security issue or have something that shouldn't appear
in public, email
<a href="mailto:vim-scripts@rinspin.com">vim-scripts@rinspin.com</a>.
