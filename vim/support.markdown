If you see anything wrong around here, please file an issue.
We especially want to hear about scripts that have been improperly packaged
or can't immediately be used with Pathogen.

**NOTE:** if that link doesn't work, use <http://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper/issues>
and see [Combining Issue Trackers](news/2011/03/21/issues-are-moving.html) for why.
Hopefully GitHub makes the change soon.

If you'd like to report on a bug in a Vim script, contact the script's original
author.  You can fork the repository, fix it yourself, and then ask the
original author (_not_ vim-scripts) to pull your changes.  When the fixed
script appears on vim.org, it will quickly be mirrored here.

If you find a security issue or have something that shouldn't appear
in public, email
<a href="mailto:vim-scripts@rinspin.com">vim-scripts@rinspin.com</a>.
