Major changes are afoot: we've deleted and re-created every repository
on vim-scripts.  The biggest reason we did this was to convert the
email addresses in the commit messages into something that GitHub
can link automatically.  This was
also an opportunity to fix long and multi-line commit messages and
suppress a bunch of .swp files that authors uploaded accidentally.

As a side-effect of the ground-up rebuild, various problems in the
following scripts have been repaired.
If they gave you trouble before, they're worth trying again.

 - 0065 - CD.vim
 - 0356 - dbext.vim
 - 0492 - SQLUtilities
 - 0848 - SrchRplcHiGrp.vim
 - 1234 - YankRing.vim
 - 1839 - IndentAnything
 - 3025 - Command-T
 - 3051 - vimform
 - 3087 - OutlookVim
 - 3154 - vorax
 - 3169 - luainspect

It's minor, but it's nice that the dates on these scripts were fixed:

 - 1052 - The-Mail-Suite-tms
 - 1082 - MS-Word-from-VIM

Finally, in the past two months the authors of the following scripts
deleted some or all of their histories.  The missing revisions
were restored from the previous vim-scripts mirror.  This explains why
a few commits might still have the old (broken) email
addresses.  No big deal.

 - 2791 - popup\_it--su
 - 1259 - sienna
 - 2653 - cuteErrorMarker
 - 1651 - freya
 - 2109 - BBCode--Dahn
 - 2188 - earendel
 - 3118 - skk.vim-B
