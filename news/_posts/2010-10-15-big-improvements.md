Major changes are afoot: we've deleted and re-created every repository
on vim-scripts.  The biggest reason we did this was to conver the
email addresses in the commits messages into something that GitHub
can link automatically.  This was
also a good opportunity to fix long and multi-line commit messages and
suppress a bunch of .swp files that authors uploaded accidentally.

As a side-effect of the ground-up rebuild, various problems in the
following scripts have been repaired.
If they gave you trouble before, it's worth trying again.

 - 0065 - CD.vim
 - 0356 - dbext.vim
 - 0492 - SQLUtilities
 - 0848 - SrchRplcHiGrp.vim
 - 1234 - YankRing.vim
 - 1839 - IndentAnything
 - 3025 - Command-T
 - 3051 - vimform
 - 3087 - OutlookVim
 - 3154 - vorax
 - 3169 - luainspect

It's minor, but it's nice that the dates on these scripts were fixed:

 - 1052 - The-Mail-Suite-tms
 - 1082 - MS-Word-from-VIM

Finally, in the past two months the authors of the following scripts
deleted some or all of their histories.  We restored missing revisions
were restored from the previous vim-scripts mirror.  This explains why
a few commits here and there still have the old (broken) email addresses
and commit messages.

 - 2791 - popup\_it--su
 - 1259 - sienna
 - 2653 - cuteErrorMarker
 - 1651 - freya
 - 2109 - BBCode--Dahn
 - 2188 - earendel
 - 3118 - skk.vim-B
