vim-scripts.org will be down for 1/2 hour on Sunday night Pacific time.
We will move the
[last non-script repository](https://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scripts.github.com)
out of the GitHub [vim-scripts account](https://github.com/vim-scripts).
When finished, the vim-scripts account will contain 100% scripts and
its RSS feed will contain 100% script news.

The catch is, of course, that the one remaining repository is the
one hosting vim-scripts.org.
