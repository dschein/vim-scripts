As mentioned in the previous news posting, the scraper uses the RSS
feed to discover which scripts have been updated.

Unfortunately, for the past few days, vim.org's
[RSS Feed](http://feed43.com/vim-scripts.xml)
has been producing an error page.
[vim.org](http://vim.org) is still up, so authors are still
writing and uploading scripts, we just can't figure out which ones.

Not unless we download all 3622 scripts one by one.
It's possible, and we'll do it, but it takes a
lot more time and bandwidth.

This means that, until vim.org's RSS feed returns, updates will still happen
but they will be a lot slower!
