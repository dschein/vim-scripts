The scraper and its associated script and data files change
with pretty much every scrape.  They always bounce
to the top of the newsfeed, drowning out the rest of scripts.

To address this, the scraper's code has been moved to the
[vim-scraper](http://github.com/vim-scraper/) user.
The [old repo](http://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper/),
owned by the [vim-scripts](http://github.com/vim-scripts/) user,
still exists but only so its [issues](https://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper/issues)
don't get deleted.  Since it's not receiving any more commits,
it will no longer be a prominent news non-item.

The [jekyll pages](https://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scripts.github.com)
are also noisy, and haven't been moved either.

Other than these two repositories, however, vim-scripts is now 100% scripts!
The [news feed](https://github.com/vim-scripts.atom) should be a lot quieter.

Also, in unrelated news, :REPL has been renamed to REPL.

 * 1903 - REPL
