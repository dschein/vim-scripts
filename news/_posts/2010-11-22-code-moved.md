title: Scraper Code Moved
category: news
---

The scraper and its associated script and data files change
with pretty much every scrape.  This means they always bounce
to the top of the newsfeed, drowning out the rest of scripts.
How boring!

To address this, the scraper's code has been moved to the
[vim-scraper](http://github.com/vim-scraper/) user.
The [old repo](http://github/vim-scripts/vim-scraper/),
owned by the [vim-scripts](http://github.com/vim-scripts/) user,
still exists but only for its Issues tab.  Since it won't
receive any more commits, it will no longer be a prominent
news non-item.

The [jekyll pages](https://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scripts.github.com)
haven't been moved yet either, and they're also noisy.  The problem is that
GitHub makes it painful to move Jekyll pages that have a CNAME file.
They may be moved in the future, and they may not.

Other than these two repositories, vim-scripts is now 100% scripts!
The [news feed](https://github.com/vim-scripts.atom) should be a lot quieter.

Also, in unrelated news, :REPL has been renamed to REPL.

 * 1903 - REPL
