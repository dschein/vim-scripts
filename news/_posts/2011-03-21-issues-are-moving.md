title: Combining Issue Trackers
category: news

vim-scripts.org used to have one issue tracker for the website and another
issue tracker for the scraping robot.  Turns out this was needlessly confusing.
The issues for the website have been merged into the scraper and
now there is a single issue tracker for the entire project.

The issue tracker is also being moved from the vim-scripts account
to [vim-scraper][2] (the
[GitHub support request](http://support.github.com/discussions/issues-issues/557-please-move-vim-scriptsvim-scraper-to-vim-scrapervim-scraper)).
If the [vim-scraper][2] link 404s, then the move hasn't happened yet.
If it resolves then the move is complete.

*UPDATE*: The move is done.  Thanks GitHub!
