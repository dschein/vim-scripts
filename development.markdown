An automatic scraper monitors vim.org's RSS feed, converts the
changes it finds to Git commits, then pushes them up to GitHub.
If there's a problem with the packaging or uploading of a script,
the scraper is the culprit.

 * The Scraper:
   [\[Project Page\]](http://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper)
   [\[Issues\]](http://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper/issues)
   [\[RSS Feed\]](http://github.com/vim-scripts/vim-scraper/commits/master.atom)

All the pages on vim-scripts.org are generated by
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki)
and uploaded to
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
If there's a problem with the content on vim-scripts.org,
the fix goes in this repository.
