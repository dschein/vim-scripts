# {{ page.title }}

This mirror provides access to any of the scripts
[on vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/) using
[Git](http://git-scm.com/).
It was inspired by
[Pathogen's](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
simple approach to
[Vim](http://vim.org/) plugins.


**NOTE: we are in a beta period.**
We expect that things will be stable from here on out but these repos
are still too new to be sure.  Enjoy using them and visit the
[Support tab](/vim/support.html) if you see any problems.


## Usage

See the [All Scripts](/vim/scripts.html) tab above.

It's pretty easy to clone plugins into your `~/.vim/bundles` directory
and have them immediately available for use via Pathogen.

Still, it can be even easier.  See [Vim Plugin Managers](/vim/tools.html).
