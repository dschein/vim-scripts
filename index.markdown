This is a mirror of all the [Vim scripts](http://www.vim.org/scripts/).

**WARNING: we are not live yet!  Do not expect stability.**

There is still a good chance that you will have to delete and
re-clone your repos without warning.

We are close though!

## Motivation

This mirror is an attempt to improve [Vim] ecosystem by simplifying plugin management.

While [Pathogen] simplifies approach to [Vim] plugins, this mirror provides unified access to all [available Vim scripts](http://github.com/vim-scripts/repositories) using [Git].

## Requirements

[Vim], [Git], [Ruby]. 

Check out [vim-update-bundles](http://github.com/bronson/vim-update-bundles) for an easy way to maintain your plugins with [Pathogen].
