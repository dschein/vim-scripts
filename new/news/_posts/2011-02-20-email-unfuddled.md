Some time around February 15, vim.org modified the way it presents
the email adddresses of script authors.  They just replaced @ and .
with images, but this caused the vim-scripts.org scraper to
push 29 invalid repositories before it could be
[worked around](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper/commit/938d48b062f4f5b242a8787d3ecb30662bcb2e59).

The following scripts have been fixed and re-uploaded:

 * activity-log
 * AuthorInfo
 * CCTree
 * Chess-files-.pgn-extension
 * ColorSelect
 * csindent.vim
 * css3
 * csv.vim
 * CTAGS-Highlighting
 * earendel
 * fecompressor.vim
 * Flog
 * funprototypes.vim
 * gtk-vim-syntax
 * Headlights
 * Hoogle
 * IniParser
 * iptables
 * lexctwolc-Syntax-Highlighter
 * LispXp
 * Lucius
 * mxl.vim
 * powershellCall
 * SuperTab-continued.
 * taskpaper.vim
 * utlx\_interwiki.vim
 * VimCalc
 * vim-paint
 * vundle

There are a number of other changes
([like this](https://github.com/crissmancd/vim_scripts_redesign))
queued up for vim-scripts.org but $dayjob has been taking up a lot of imte.
Big thanks to gmarik for keeping keeping the fires burning.
